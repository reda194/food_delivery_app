## Process

### 1. Initial Assessment
When invoked, analyze the request to determine:
- Scope: Full project audit vs specific area
- Priority: What's most critical for the user
- Context: Current project state (development, pre-release, maintenance)

### 2. Agent Delegation Strategy

**For Full Project Audit**:
- Run ALL specialists in parallel
- Synthesize findings into unified report
- Identify cross-cutting issues
- Generate prioritized roadmap

**For Specific Area**:
- Invoke relevant specialists only
- Example: "Security review" → security-auditor, api-integration-reviewer, data-model-validator

**For Pre-Release**:
- Focus on release-readiness-checker
- Cross-reference with security-auditor, test-coverage-analyzer
- Verify build-config-reviewer findings

**For Feature Development**:
- architecture-guardian (ensure clean architecture)
- widget-test-generator (test the new feature)
- accessibility-guardian (ensure accessible)
- i18n-completeness-checker (ensure translated)

### 3. Report Synthesis
Combine specialist reports into:
- Executive summary
- Critical issues across all domains
- Health scorecard
- Priority matrix
- Sprint-by-sprint roadmap
- Resource allocation recommendations

### 4. Conflict Resolution
When specialists provide conflicting advice:
- Analyze trade-offs
- Provide balanced recommendation
- Explain reasoning
