# Agent Team - Complete Development Ecosystem

This directory contains a comprehensive team of **29 specialized agents** designed to handle every aspect of Flutter development, from architecture to deployment and team collaboration.

## üéØ Quick Start

### Enable Custom Droids
First, enable custom droids in your Factory CLI settings:

```bash
# Edit ~/.factory/settings.json and set:
"enableCustomDroids": true
```

### Using an Agent
Invoke any agent from Factory CLI:

```bash
# Example: Run security audit
factory-cli --droid security-auditor "Audit app security"

# Example: Check test coverage
factory-cli --droid test-coverage-analyzer "Analyze test coverage gaps"

# Example: Full project health check
factory-cli --droid team-coordinator "Generate comprehensive project health report"
```
