   - Data layer implements domain interfaces
   - Presentation depends on domain only

2. **Write tests as you go**
   - Test use cases immediately
   - Test repositories with mocks
   - Test blocs with bloc_test

3. **Use version control properly**
   - Feature branches
   - Meaningful commit messages
   - Pull requests with reviews

4. **Document as you code**
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Document public APIs
   - Keep README updated

5. **Code reviews**
   - Review each feature
   - Check for best practices
   - Ensure consistency

6. **Regular refactoring**
   - Eliminate code duplication
   - Extract reusable widgets
   - Improve naming

---

## Estimated Timeline

**Total: 14-15 weeks (3.5 months)**

- Phase 0: 1 week
- Phase 1-2: 2 weeks
- Phase 3-8: 7 weeks (core features)
- Phase 9-12: 4 weeks (secondary features)
- Phase 13-14: 2 weeks (polish & deploy)

**Note:** This is for a single developer. With a team, you can parallelize phases.

---

## Team Structure Recommendation

For faster development:

**Team of 3:**
- Developer 1: Authentication, Profile, Settings
- Developer 2: Home, Restaurants, Menu, Search
- Developer 3: Cart, Checkout, Orders, Favorites

**Team of 4:**
- Developer 1: Authentication, Onboarding, Splash
- Developer 2: Home, Restaurants, Menu
- Developer 3: Cart, Checkout, Orders
- Developer 4: Search, Favorites, Profile, Notifications

**Backend Developer:**
- API development in parallel
- Provide mock APIs initially
- Real APIs ready by Phase 7

**Designer:**
- UI/UX design ready before Phase 1
- Provide all assets and design specs
- Review implementation continuously

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks:

1. **API delays**: Use mock data initially
2. **Complex features**: Break into smaller tasks
3. **Third-party issues**: Have fallback plans
4. **Performance problems**: Profile early and often
5. **Scope creep**: Stick to MVP, iterate later

### Mitigation Strategies:

- Daily standups
- Weekly progress reviews
- Continuous testing
- Early integration
- Buffer time for unexpected issues

**Remember:**
- Quality over speed
- Test continuously
- Iterate based on feedback
- Keep users at the center

Good luck with your implementation!
