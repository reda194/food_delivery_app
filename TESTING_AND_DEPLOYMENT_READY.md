## 🚀 Ready for Integration

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
cd food_delivery_app
flutter pub get
```

2. **Initialize Services in main.dart**
```dart
import 'package:food_delivery_app/core/services/payment_service.dart';
import 'package:food_delivery_app/core/services/geocoding_service.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // Initialize Stripe
  PaymentService.instance.initializeStripe(
    publishableKey: 'YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY',
    secretKey: 'YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY',
  );

  // Initialize Google Maps
  GeocodingService.instance.initialize('YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY');

  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

3. **Get API Keys**
- Stripe: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
- Google Maps: https://console.cloud.google.com/

- [ ] Update backend API endpoints
- [ ] Configure environment variables

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Implemented ✅
- Payment data handled securely through Stripe
- Address validation prevents invalid data
- Input validation in all use cases
- Error messages don't expose sensitive data

### Recommended (Future)
- [ ] Rate limiting on payment attempts
- [ ] Fraud detection integration
- [ ] PCI compliance audit
- [ ] Address verification service (AVS)

---

## 🌐 Backend API Requirements

Your backend needs to support these endpoints:

```
POST /coupons/validate
Body: { "code": "PROMO20" }
Response: { "discount": 20, "valid": true }

POST /menu/check-availability
Body: { "item_ids": ["item1", "item2", "item3"] }
Response: {
  "availability": {
    "item1": true,
    "item2": false,
    "item3": true
  }
}
```

---

## 📦 Dependencies Added

```yaml
dependencies:
  path_provider: ^2.1.2  # For receipt file storage

# Already available:
  google_maps_flutter: ^2.5.3  # For maps integration
  geocoding: ^2.1.1  # For geocoding (alternative to our service)
  dio: ^5.4.1  # For HTTP requests
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Production)
1. **Configure API Keys**
   - Get Stripe keys (test and live)
   - Get Google Maps API key
   - Set environment variables

2. **Backend Integration**
   - Implement `/coupons/validate` endpoint
   - Implement `/menu/check-availability` endpoint
   - Test with real API

3. **Payment Testing**
   - Test with Stripe test cards
   - Verify 3D Secure flow
   - Test refund process

### Short Term (Recommended)
1. **Enable Firebase** (for push notifications)
2. **Add Analytics** (track user behavior)
3. **Error Tracking** (Sentry or Firebase Crashlytics)
4. **Performance Monitoring**

### Long Term (Nice to Have)
1. **Add More Payment Methods**
   - PayPal integration
   - Apple Pay
   - Google Pay
2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Real-time order tracking
   - Chat with delivery driver
   - Order scheduling

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Expected Warnings
- Firebase-related errors (Firebase is commented out in pubspec.yaml)
- These are intentional and don't affect functionality

### Limitations
1. **Payment Service**: Requires Stripe account and API keys
2. **Geocoding Service**: Requires Google Maps API key and billing enabled
3. **Receipt Storage**: Requires storage permissions on device

### Workarounds
- Payment: Can use test mode with Stripe test keys
- Geocoding: Can use free tier (up to limits)
- Receipts: Will prompt for permissions on first use
